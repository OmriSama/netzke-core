module Netzke::Core
  # A component can access and update its state through the +state+ method, e.g.:
  #
  #     state[:position] = {:x => 100, :y => 200}
  #
  #     state[:position] #=> {:x => 100, :y => 200}
  #
  # Default implementation uses session to store stateful data, but can be implemented differently by 3rd-party gems.
  #
  # == Sharing state
  #
  # Different components can share the state by specifying the same +persistent_key+ option.
  #
  # Note that the provided persistence_key has effect on _application_ level, _not_ only within the view.
  # By default +persistence_key+ is set to component's +js_id+. Thus, _two components named equally will share the state even being used in different Rails views_.
